We're a friendly bunch so don't hesitate to jump in and say hello.\r\n\r\nThis is a new server and is still in the Beta phase. This means that adjustments will be made almost daily to get everything setup and running how we want. Do not get discouraged if something isnt exactly how you would like as some things will still be changed and tweaked over the next few weeks.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nProdigy"

Use the Descended Structures Mod and place Descended Shields to protect your base.\r\n-Do secure your store bought items. Clone your special Dino's and Soultrap them then place into a Descended Vault. I will not Refund or Replace them.\r\n-Do be careful when transfering items between servers. This can be buggy and you might lose your items.\r\n\r\n\r\n-Do not Undermesh, Glitch, Exploit, Abuse, Cheat, Use Racial Slurs(Including Names), or use Profanity/Insults in Global Chat.\r\n-Do not spam Foundations/Structures to excessively block off areas.\r\n-Do not build too close to another base. You should be out of/on the edge of clip range.\r\n-Do not build to close to known resource spawns. It's rude and you might get your base wiped.\r\n-Do not Generate boss dino's at someone else's base. If I get a report with Proof it will get you banned.\r\n\r\n-I am using Nitrado's Servers as they seem to be the best at the moment. I won't be held responsible for lost Items or Dino's bought from stores after a server crash, bugged saves, server restores or wild dino's breaking items."

Staff will have to manually add the points to your in-game shop so you can then purchase the items. Due to crazy work schedule ATM most week nights the transfer will be done from 6cst to 10cst. Weekend time frame will be much more flexible."
